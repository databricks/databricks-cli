Databricks Python REST Client 2.0 for interacting with various services.

Currently supports services including clusters and jobs.

Requires Python 2.7.9 or above.

To get started, below is an example usage of the Python API client.

  # Import databricks package:
  from databricks import *

  # Create a client:
  userName = "user@company.com"
  password = "MySecretPassword"
  client = ApiClient(userName, password, host = "https://dbc-12345678-9101.cloud.databricks.com")

  # List jobs:
  jobs = JobsService(client)
  print jobs.list_jobs()

  # For help:
  help(databricks)

  # To examine available services:
  help(databricks.service)

  # To examine the jobs API:
  help(JobsService)
